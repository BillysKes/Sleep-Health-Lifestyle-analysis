The aim of this data science project is to analyze the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, which encompasses 400 rows and 13 columns. This dataset provides comprehensive insights into various factors influencing sleep quality and daily habits among individuals. By implementing Exploratory Data Analysis, we intend to uncover patterns, correlations, and significant associations within the data.

## Bar Charts

Among the four BMI categories, Majority of individuals have normal body mass index or they are overweight while individuals with normal BMI are slightly more numbered compared to overweight. Also, most individuals don't have any sleep disorder but those who have ie.sleep apnea, insomnia, if combined, they are almost as equal in number compared to those who don't have any sleep problems.
